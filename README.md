# Password Manager <MySQL>
This was an College Project which ended up landing me an A *"Just had to brang"*. This was an amazing project to work on! The requirements for the project were the following.

- The user would need to enter an master password to add, update, remove and decrypt an password.
- All the passwords had to be encrypted.
- All the passwords had to be stored inside an MySQL Database.

The encryption method that was choosen for the master password was SHA-256 because it's an one-way encryption method and for the passwords the user stored on the database they were encrypted using the AES encryption method.
